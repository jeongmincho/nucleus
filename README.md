# Nucleus Fitness Tracker

[Nucleus Fitness Tracker](https://nucleusfitnesstracker.netlify.com/) is the latest trending fitness tracker to optimize your workout.

I had a lot of takeaways from this project. Firstly, the project really allowed me to internalize the concepts of adding, removing, and toggling classes from DOM nodes. I learned how amazingly complicated and buggy the program can become if you start to use a mix of add/remove and toggle. I had to re-write a lot of the logic by completely removing the toggles in order to make my program run properly. Second, this project allowed me to learn more about different CSS properties, experiment with transition times, and create modal-like effects with custom CSS classes. Furthermore, I also learned how to deploy a static website using Netlify, which took a long time configuring the right directory settings, but eventually worked. Finally, I was able to put into practice OOP by creating a class which acted as a template for me to generate exercises as instances of the class. As a result, my program became a lot more modularized and easier to follow. By doing a lot of DOM manipulation of nested nodes, I realized that a framework that handles this highly repetitive, and tedious logic would be very beneficial moving forward.
